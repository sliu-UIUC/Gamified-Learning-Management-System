# Gamified-Learning-Management-System
• Incorporated gamified elements including item shops, currencies, narratives and navigation map to incentivize learning.
• Implemented quizzes, user progress, user profile, currency to buy power-ups from shop and posts for reviewing course material. 
• Designed and implemented the web app with Bootstrap and Django
• Collect data from surveys and web app statistics to evaluate the learning effectiveness in comparison with traditional learning.


The website is deployed on Pythonanywhere and website is here: https://misterfish.pythonanywhere.com/.

I taught myself Django for building this website. I use some bootstrap for front-end rendering just for convenience. The website has features including user register/login, quizzes, content posting/viewing, store, and user inventories. Users can earn in-game currencies by doing quizzes to purchase stuff from the store. Purchased items will be added to user's inventory. 

More features will be added to it, including more quiz types, more story telling/narratives and maybe powerups.
